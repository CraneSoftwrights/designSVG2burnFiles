# designSVG2burnPDF
An XSLT stylesheet to convert declarative SVG into derivative SVG and associated burn files for a laser cutter machine.

User documentation is coming (I promise!).

Meanwhile, see the [Declarative Amsterdam 2024 proceedings](https://declarative.amsterdam/prd-data/article/da.2024/da.2024.holman.play-ball/da.2024.holman.play-ball.pdf) for a discussion of two applications of this work and why these stylesheets were developed.

Stylesheet documentation is found in [designSVG2burnFiles.html](designSVG2burnFiles.html) and [convertBadStrokes4designSVG.html](convertBadStrokes4designSVG.html).
